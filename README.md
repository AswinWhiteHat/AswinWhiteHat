ðŸ”¥ About Me

I'm a dedicated Bug Bounty Hunter, specializing in web application security and vulnerability research. I was pursuing a BSc in Computer Science with a focus on Cybersecurity but decided to drop out to fully immerse myself in hands-on learning and earning through bug bounty hunting.

With proficiency in Python, Bash, JavaScript, networking, and a variety of security tools, I apply my knowledge across both Kali Linux and Windows/WSL environments. I leverage powerful tools like Burp Suite, Nmap, Metasploit, and ZAP for penetration testing, and I am familiar with AWS VPC.
